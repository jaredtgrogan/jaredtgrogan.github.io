Hello! I am Jared Grogan, a fifth year PhD student in Columbia University's Economics department. My research interests include labor economics, public economics (education and crime) and economic history. I am currently writing my dissertation on the labor economics of the trucking industry with emphasis on labor supply, driver turnover, and driver compensation. I will add abstracts for these projects as they become more developed.

Background
======
Prior to enrolling at Columbia, I completed my undergraduate studies in mathematics and economics at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, worked as a research assistant to Professor David Card at UC Berkeley, and also worked as a predoctoral research assistant to the Princeton Industrial Relations Section. More details of my academic background can be found on the CV page.
