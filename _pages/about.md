Hello! I am Jared Grogan, a first year PhD candidate in Columbia University's 
Economics Department. My research interests include labor economics, public 
economics (education and crime) and economic history. While I have some projects 
currently in the works, none of them are in a state to be presented at this time. 
In the future, I will add descriptions and details for these projects as they 
become more developed. 

Background
======
I was born and raised in East Tennessee. Prior to enrolling at Columbia, I 
completed undergraduate studies at the University of Alabama in Huntsville in 2018,  
worked as a research assistant to Professor David Card at UC Berkeley in 2017, 
and worked as a predoctoral research assistant to the Princeton Industrial 
Relations Section. More details of my academic background can be found on the 
CV page.
